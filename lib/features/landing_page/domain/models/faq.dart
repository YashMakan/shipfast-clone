    question: 'What are the ShipFast Leaderboards?',
    answer:
    '''The Leaderboards are a fun way to showcase your startup.

Startups are ranked by revenue (verified by Stripe), so you can see who's making the most money.

Leaderboards also help you gain exposure by showing your startup to thousands of entrepreneurs who visit the leaderboards page every month.''',

    question: 'Does ShipFast work with AI (Cursor, Copilot)?',
    answer:
    '''It does not only work with AI, it's built for it.

ShipFast comes with a complete codebaseâ€”which gives your AI code editor real context to build full features in seconds.

You can just ask your AI to build the feature you need, and it will generate the code for you, using the naming convention, file structure, and best practices you're used to.''',

  FaqModel(id: 'q5', question: 'Javascript or Typescript?', answer: 'Both! You can choose once you get access'),

    id: 'q7',
    question: 'My tech stack is different, can I still use it?',
    answer:
    '''Yes, as long as you're comfortable with React & NextJS.

Libraries are independent. You can use SendGrid instead of Mailgun, LemonSqueezy instead of Stripe, or Postgres instead of MongoDB, for instance.''',
  ),
  FaqModel(
    id: 'q8',
    question: 'Is it a website template?',
    answer:
    '''It's more than just a template. You can copy/paste sections to build your site quickly, like a pricing section, an FAQ, and even an entire blog. You also get a bunch of UI components like buttons, modals, popovers, etc.

The NextJS starter also comes with handy tools you need to run an online businessâ€”payment processing, emails, SEO, etc.''',

  FaqModel(
    id: 'q9',
    question: 'Is ShipFast better than other boilerplates?',
    answer:
    '''Customers do NOT buy code.

Customers buy a life transformation.

They ship startups. Every week. And they make \$ from it (see for yourself).''',
  ),
  FaqModel(
    id: 'q10',
    question: 'Is ShipFast better than AI tools like Lovable or Bolt?',
    answer:
    '''Lovable and Bolt are great tools if you want to build a landing page quickly.

But they don't help you ship a startup.
- ShipFast is a complete startup boilerplate. It comes with a payment system, a database, login, battle-tested UI components, and much more.
- It gives your AI code editor real context to build full features in seconds.
- Reuse ShipFast across projects so you're not wasting time relearning a new setup.''',

  FaqModel(
    id: 'q11',
    question: 'Are there any other costs associated?',
    answer:
    '''Many hosting platforms, like Vercel, let you host a project for free (front-end + back-end) and MongoDB/Supabase have free tiers â€” so you can launch for first app for \$0/month.

If you use Magic Link sign-ups, you'll spend \$1 per 1,000 users.''',
  ),
  FaqModel(
    id: 'q12',
    question: 'How often is ShipFast updated?',
    answer:
    '''I ship like a madman & use ShipFast for all my projects, so I'm updating it regularly. Last update 5 months ago.''',
  ),
  FaqModel(
    id: 'q13',
    question: 'Can I get a refund?',
    answer:
    '''After you've got access to the repo, ShipFast is yours forever, so it can't be refunded.

But rest assured, users of ShipFast ship startups in 7 days on average and make their first \$ online in record time.''',
  ),
  FaqModel(
    id: 'q14',
    question: 'Can I use PayPal?',
    answer:
    '''Yes! You can send over the USD equivalent of the plan you want to purchase (\$199 or \$249 or \$299) to my PayPal account: paypal.me/marclouvion

Once done, please email me your GitHub username so I can give you access to the repo.

Please allow a few hours to get access.
