      'a':
      "The Leaderboards are a fun way to showcase your startup.\n\nStartups are ranked by revenue (verified by Stripe), so you can see who's making the most money.\n\nLeaderboards also help you gain exposure by showing your startup to thousands of entrepreneurs who visit the leaderboards page every month."

I partner with the following companies to give you discounts on their products:\n- Rewardful â€” 30% OFF for 3 months\n- There's An AI For That â€” \$200 ads credit\n- daisyUI â€” 50% OFF\n- DataFast â€” 30% OFF on all plans\n- Typefully â€” 30% OFF for 1 year\n- Vercel â€” \$100/mo off for 6 months (10 winners/month)\n- Resend â€” \$100/mo off for 6 months (10 winners/month)\n- MakerAdsGuide â€” 60% OFF\n- SEO Course â€” 20% OFF\n\nMost of these discounts are for marketing tools and services to help you acquire customers and generate revenue faster."

      'a':
      "It does not only work with AI, it's built for it.\n\nShipFast comes with a complete codebaseâ€”which gives your AI code editor real context to build full features in seconds.\n\nYou can just ask your AI to build the feature you need, and it will generate the code for you, using the naming convention, file structure, and best practices you're used to."

You also get a bunch of UI components like buttons, modals, popovers, etc.\n\nThe NextJS starter also comes with handy tools you need to run an online businessâ€”payment processing, emails, SEO, etc."

      'a':
      "Lovable and Bolt are great tools if you want to build a landing page quickly.\n\nBut they don't help you ship a startup.\n- ShipFast is a complete startup boilerplate. It comes with a payment system, a database, login, battle-tested UI components, and much more.\n- It gives your AI code editor real context to build full features in seconds.\n- Reuse ShipFast across projects so you're not wasting time relearning a new setup."

      'q': 'Are there any other costs associated?',
      'a':
      "Many hosting platforms, like Vercel, let you host a project for free (front-end + back-end) and MongoDB/Supabase have free tiers â€” so you can launch for first app for \$0/month.\n\nIf you use Magic Link sign-ups, you'll spend \$1 per 1,000 users."
